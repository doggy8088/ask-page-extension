Instructions:
1. Identify the current version from `manifest.json` and `package.json`.
2. Increment the patch version (e.g., 1.2.3 â†’ 1.2.4).
3. Update the version in `manifest.json`, `package.json`, and `README.md`.
4. Add a new entry to `CHANGELOG.md` describing bug fixes, minor improvements, or documentation updates.

    Use `git --no-pager diff origin/main..HEAD` to identify changes since the last release. Ignore version information changes.

5. Ensure no breaking changes are introduced.
6. Follow the AskPage project's formatting and Traditional Chinese requirements for user-facing text.

Output:
